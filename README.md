Projects Overview
This folder contains four advanced computer vision projects focusing on real-time interactive applications using OpenCV and MediaPipe:

1. Capstone Project: Market Sentiment Analysis and Prediction
A comprehensive system that integrates financial data analysis and sentiment extraction to predict market trends. Combines numerical data and textual sentiment using machine learning models.

2. Color Detection and Tracking
Detects a specified color in real-time from webcam video. Converts a chosen BGR color to HSV color space, creates a mask, and extracts the color region from the video stream using OpenCV.

3. Gesture-Controlled Dynamic Bar
Implements a real-time, hand-gesture-based interactive control bar using finger position and distance metrics from MediaPipe hand landmarks. This dynamic bar visually represents a continuous value controlled by finger movements, enabling intuitive, contactless control interfaces.

4. Hand Gesture Recognition and Analysis
Detects and tracks multiple hands, extracts finger landmarks, determines how many fingers are up, calculates distances between fingers, and annotates hands with bounding boxes. Uses MediaPipe's hand detection with custom utilities for finger counting and distance measurement.
