## Projects Overview

1. **MediaPipe-Driven Hand Pose Estimation with CNN Digit Inference**  
  Detect and recognize handwritten or displayed numbers from live webcam feed using computer vision and machine learning techniques.

2. **Color Detection**  
   Detects and highlights a specified color range in live webcam feed using HSV color space and OpenCV.

3. **Hand Gesture Control Module**  
   A reusable Python class leveraging MediaPipe for hand landmark detection, finger counting, and distance measurement between points on the hand.

4. **Gesture-Controlled Draggable and Resizable Rectangles**
   Use finger pinch gestures to drag and resize multiple interactive rectangles on screen via real-time hand tracking with cvzone and OpenCV.
