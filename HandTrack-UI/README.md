# Hand Gesture Projects

This repo contains multiple computer vision projects using hand gestures with OpenCV and MediaPipe.

## Projects

### 1. Hand Tracking & Finger Detection
- Detects hand landmarks
- Counts fingers up
- Calculates distances between fingertips
- Visualizes interaction with basic bar UI

### 2. Virtual Drag and Resize Rectangles
- Drag rectangles using a pinch gesture
- Resize them using distance between thumb and index
- Remove rectangles by dragging them into a circular "trash" zone
- Smooth color gradients using sigmoid mapping
- Built with `cvzone`, `OpenCV`, and `MediaPipe`
